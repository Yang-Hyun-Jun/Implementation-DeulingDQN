# Implementation: Dueling DQN

My implementation code of Dueling DQN

[Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning, 2016 ICML](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06581.pdf)

# Overview

- In this paper, the Dueling architecture is proposed, which separates the learning of State value and Advantage value instead of directly learning Q values.
- It is an architecture that is advantageous in terms of simplicity of implementation and suitable for reinforcement learning.
- Implementation Envirionment: Stock Market with 1 minute candle stick data
